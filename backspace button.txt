This code retrieves an element from the HTML document with an ID of 
"res" using the getElementById() method of the document object, and 
assigns it to a constant variable called display.

Then, it sets the value property of the display element to a modified
 version of its current value. The slice() method is used to create a
 new string that contains all but the last character of the current 
 value. The slice() method takes two arguments: the first argument 
 specifies the starting index of the substring, and the second argument
 (which is negative in this case) specifies the ending index of the substring
 from the end of the string. In this case, the second argument -1 means to 
 exclude the last character from the substring.

So, essentially, this code removes the last character from the current
 value of the display element. This could be used, for example, in a
 calculator application to simulate the behavior of the "backspace" key,
 allowing the user to undo the entry of the last digit.
